# CORD19STS-COVID-19-Semantic-Textual-Similarity-Dataset

Given that the original repository has been deprecated, we have transitioned to using this new repository to host the CORD19STS dataset. This dataset is designed for learning Semantic Textual Similarity over COVID-19.

For more details, please refer to our paper on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02461.pdf).
